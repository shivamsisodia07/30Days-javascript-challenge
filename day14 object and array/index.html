      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      team[3] = "hy";
      // now here is the problem!
      //   console.log(team);
      //   console.log(players);
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "heee";
      //   console.log(team2);
      //   console.log(players);
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "hee";
      // console.log(team3);
      // console.log(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "hee";
      //   console.log(team4);
      //   console.log(players);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "heew";
      //   console.log(team5);
      //   console.log(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      //   const people = person;
      //   people.number = 90;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const people2 = { ...person };
      //   people2.age = 100;
      //   console.log(people2);
      //   console.log(person);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      const people3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 90 });
      //   console.log(people3);
      //   console.log(person);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      const person2 = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,

        social: {
          twitter: "@shivam",
          facebook: "shivam",
        },
      };
      //   lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const people4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person2));
      people4.social.twitter = "@gessfa";
      console.log(people4);
      console.log(person2);
